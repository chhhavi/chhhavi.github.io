    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <paragraph>I'm Chhavi. Iâ€™m currently learning to build my volitional muscles at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, a programmer's retreat. Before that I worked on a real-time ranking system on the [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/) leaderboard team.
        Prior to that, I was an Engineering Manager and Senior Software Engineer working at Pivotal building [Cloud Foundry](https://www.link-to-cloud-foundry). I studied Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada.
        
        I have lived in 4 countries, however I am currently living in Brooklyn, New York. I love to bike, play board games, optimize everything, and travel.
