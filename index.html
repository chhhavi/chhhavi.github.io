            <div >I’m currently learning to build my volitional muscles at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/"> Recurse Center</a>, an educational retreat for programmers. </div>
            <div >In my career, I’ve worked on a real-time ranking system on the <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/">Peloton</a> leaderboard team, managed and mentored engineers at Pivotal (now <a href="https://www.vmware.com/"> VMware</a>), and helped build <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry</a>, an open-source platform as a service that allows you to easily deploy web applications on the cloud.</div>
            <div >I’m passionate about making teams successful, not only by maximizing technical excellence, but by helping to create a psychologically safe and diverse environment. </div>
            <div >Outside of work, I like to bike, play chess and tetris, optimize everything, and travel. I live in Brooklyn, New York and attended the University of Waterloo in Canada where I grew up.</div>
